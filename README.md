#Project Overview: CarWeb

CarWeb is a web application designed to manage information about cars. It employs the .NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to maintain a structured and organized codebase. The application interacts with a Firebase database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on car-related data.

#.NET MVC Structure:

Model:

The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. In CarWeb, the Model includes classes that define the structure of car entities, such as Car, Manufacturer, Owner, etc.
These classes may contain properties like CarId, ManufacturerName, OwnerName, Model, Year, etc., reflecting the attributes of a car.
View:

The View component is responsible for rendering the user interface. In CarWeb, Views are created using Razor syntax (.cshtml files) to generate dynamic HTML content.
Views display information about cars, manufacturers, and owners to users in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.
Additionally, Views may contain forms for user input, enabling CRUD operations on car data.
Controller:

The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user requests, processes input data, and updates the Model accordingly.
In CarWeb, Controllers contain action methods that respond to HTTP requests from clients. These methods perform CRUD operations on car data by interacting with the Firebase database.
For example, there might be CarController, ManufacturerController, and OwnerController, each responsible for managing CRUD operations related to their respective entities.
Firebase Database Integration:

Firebase Realtime Database:

CarWeb utilizes Firebase Realtime Database to store and retrieve car-related data. Firebase offers a scalable NoSQL database solution that synchronizes data in real-time across clients.
The database is structured to store collections of cars, manufacturers, owners, etc., each represented as JSON objects.
Through Firebase SDKs or RESTful APIs, the .NET MVC application communicates with the Firebase database to perform CRUD operations.
CRUD Operations:

Create: When a user submits a form to add a new car, for example, the Controller receives the input data, creates a new Car object, and sends it to Firebase to be stored as a new document.
Read: When a user requests to view a list of cars or details of a specific car, the Controller fetches the relevant data from Firebase and passes it to the View for rendering.
Update: If a user edits the details of a car, the Controller retrieves the modified data, updates the corresponding document in Firebase, and reflects the changes in the View.
Delete: When a user requests to delete a car record, the Controller deletes the corresponding document from Firebase, ensuring that the data remains consistent across the application.
